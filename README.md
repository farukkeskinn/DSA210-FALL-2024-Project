# Health Data Analysis Web App

## Hypothesis

The primary hypothesis of this analysis was to explore the correlation between *body mass* and *basal metabolism*, aiming to determine whether higher body mass leads to increased basal calorie expenditure. Additionally, we analyzed the relationships between step count, active calorie expenditure, and total calories burned to gain deeper insights into the factors influencing body mass.

Our findings provided key evidence supporting the hypothesis, as basal metabolism showed a strong positive correlation (r â‰ˆ 0.77) with body mass. This confirms the metabolic relationship tied to resting energy expenditure. However, step count and active calorie expenditure showed weaker correlations, suggesting these factors have a lesser direct impact on body mass.

## Key Insights

- *Activity Patterns*: Higher step counts correlate with increased active calorie burn.
- *Body Mass*: Seasonal variations affect weight, with patterns tied to activity levels.
- *Correlations*: Basal calorie burn strongly correlates with body mass, while active calories are minimally related to weight changes.
